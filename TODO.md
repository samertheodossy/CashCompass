## Purpose of this file

TODO.md is a working list of ideas, bugs, and tasks.

- It may contain unstructured, exploratory, or incomplete items.
- It is not the authoritative roadmap.

Only items that are refined, structured, and prioritized should be promoted to `ENHANCEMENTS.md`.

## Open items (not done)

### Easy wins (quick fixes)

Small HTML/docs/a11y tasks; check off when shipped. *(Unnumbered — pick in any order.)*

- [ ] **Bank Add new — sidebar hint** — Add a short muted note next to the **Add new** form in **`PlannerDashboard.html`** (parity with the web app’s **`Dashboard_Body.html`** info column) so spreadsheet-menu users see the same “where rows go / year block” context.
- [ ] **Bank Add new — DRY inline copy** — On **`Dashboard_Body.html`**, replace the two-paragraph right-column blurb with **one line** plus **Help → Assets** so the canonical detail stays in **`Dashboard_Help.html`**.
- [ ] **Docs — Bank add one-liner** — Add a single bullet to **`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** and/or **`SESSION_NOTES.md`**: Assets → Bank Accounts → Add new (INPUT + SYS rows, no full planner on save, run **Run Planner + Refresh Snapshot** after).
- [ ] **Status lines (item 19 sweep)** — Grep for **`setStatus('planner_status', …)`**; move any remaining **panel-specific** errors to the same pattern as Bills Due / Quick add (see **Codebase cleanups → 19** below). Keep truly global init errors on **`planner_status`**.
- [ ] **Help — cross-link to Assets** — In **`Dashboard_Help.html`** **Introduction** or **Overview**, add one sentence with a link to **`#help-assets`** so “create / edit bank accounts” is discoverable from the top of Help.
- [ ] **A11y — Bank mode segment** — For **Update \| Add new**, tighten **`role` / `aria-selected`** (already partly there) with **`aria-controls`** on the tab buttons pointing at the two mode wraps, or a visible **`fieldset` / `legend`**, in **`Dashboard_Body.html`** and **`PlannerDashboard.html`**.

### Important — Activity / HISTORY flow (LOG - Activity vs OUT - History)

**LOG - Activity** = **event** ledger (who/when/amount); dashboard **Remove** is **donation-only** for now (**`deleteActivityLogRow`**); donations may also remove a matching **INPUT - Donation** row. Other event types: greyed UI + delete on the sheet if needed. **Smart undo** for **Quick add** (`quick_pay`) / house expense / bills — phased list below. **OUT - History** = **planner run** snapshots. Implementation: **`activity_log.js`**, **`appendActivityLog_`**, Help **Activity log**.

**Done (recent)**  
- **Phase 3 — Upcoming** — **`upcoming_add`** / **`upcoming_status`** / **`upcoming_cashflow`** in **`upcoming_expenses.js`**; Cash Flow from Upcoming uses **`quickAddPayment`** with **`suppressActivityLog: true`** so **`quick_pay`** is not duplicated; **`quick_add_payment.js`** returns **`activitySnapshot`** for callers.  
- **Phase 4 — House expenses** — **`house_expense`** after **`addHouseExpense`**; if the form also posts to Cash Flow, **`quickAddPayment`** runs with **`suppressActivityLog: true`** so you do not get a second **`quick_pay`** row for the same save. Activity **Type** uses the House Expenses form type (Repair, **Maintenance**, Utilities, etc.; stored **Tax** displays as **Property Tax**).  
- **Activity page UI** — Logged **date range** (from/to on one row in the toolbar), **Payee** contains, **Type** dropdown (options computed from all rows in **LOG - Activity**, same rules as the Type column), **Amount** min/max, sortable table, **20 rows per page** with Previous/Next (**500** matching rows max per Apply; summary notes if truncated). Backend: **`getActivityDashboardData`**.  
- **Debt Planner email** — Short action block (overdue, pay‑now / pay‑soon line items), debts omitted when the current Cash Flow month is already “handled,” definitions in Help **Debt Planner email** (not repeated in the email body).  
- **Assets → Bank Accounts — Add new** — **`addBankAccountFromDashboard`** (**`bank_accounts.js`**): rows on **INPUT - Bank Accounts** (current year block) + **SYS - Accounts**; **`bank_account_add`** on **LOG - Activity**; UI **Update \| Add new**; stable **Bank Accounts** heading; Help **Assets** subsection updated.
- **Assets → Bank Accounts — Final cleanup (SYS row formatting + Priority + activity Amount)** — `appendAccountsRowForNewBank_` (`bank_accounts.js`) now clones neighbor-row formatting (borders, font, number formats, row height) onto newly appended **SYS - Accounts** rows via a new `findAccountsTemplateRow_` helper + `PASTE_FORMAT`, matching the Investments pattern. New **Priority** field (`<input type="number">`, range **1–99**, default **9**) on the Add form in both `Dashboard_Body.html` and `PlannerDashboard.html`; `createBankAccount` validates and sends it; `addBankAccountFromDashboard` writes it to the canonical **SYS - Accounts → Priority** column consumed by `planner_core.js → normalizeAccounts_` (no schema change to **INPUT - Bank Accounts**, which has no Priority column). `bank_account_add` removed from `activityLogIsNonMonetaryEvent_` so **Amount** now shows the supplied opening balance in **LOG - Activity** (or $0.00 when none was provided); `bank_account_deactivate` stays non-monetary with Amount as **—**. Help, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, and `SESSION_NOTES.md` updated.
- **Assets → Bank Accounts — Stop tracking + Active + UX parity** — **`deactivateBankAccountFromDashboard`** (**`bank_accounts.js`**): flips **Active = No** on every **INPUT - Bank Accounts** row across year blocks (self-heals the Active column at col 14 per block) + mirror **SYS - Accounts** row; preserves month history, Available Now, Min Buffer, Type, Use Policy, and reserves the name. **`bank_account_deactivate`** on **LOG - Activity** (Type: **Bank**, Action: **Tracking stopped**, Amount: **—**). UI is a secondary **Stop tracking** button in **Update** mode on web + sidebar with inline confirm; Add-new Type is a controlled `<select>` populated from existing **SYS - Accounts** types; inline name-error slot replaces popups; create/stop flows show action-specific status text ("Creating bank account…" / "Stopping tracking…"). Inactive accounts drop out of the Bank Account dropdown via shared `getInactiveBankAccountsSet_` (blank / missing / unknown = active for backward compatibility). Active writes inherit row formatting via `writeActiveCellWithRowFormat_` (retrofitted into the add-account writers too). Help **Bank Accounts** + **Bank Accounts Stop tracking** subsections updated.
- **Assets → House Values — Add new** — **`addHouseFromDashboard`** (**`house_values.js`**): rows on **INPUT - House Values** (Loan Amount Left in col 2) + **SYS - House Assets** (neighbor row formatting copied), plus auto-creation of **HOUSES - {House}** with canonical headers + column widths copied from an existing HOUSES sheet; transactional rollback on any write failure. **`house_add`** on **LOG - Activity** (Type: **House Expenses**, Action: **House added**). UI **Update \| Add new** on web + sidebar; inline **`.field-error`** under the House name field for duplicate/invalid names (focuses + selects). **Properties → House Expenses** selector refreshes on every tab nav (`Dashboard_Script_Render.html`), so new houses are usable immediately. Help **Assets → House Values**, **Activity log**, **Properties**, **HOUSES sheet**, and **Sheet names** sections updated.
- **Assets → House Values — Stop tracking (soft sale)** — **`deactivateHouseFromDashboard`** (**`house_values.js`**): flips **Active = No** on every **INPUT - House Values** row for the house across all year blocks (canonical source; self-heals the Active column per block) and mirrors the same flag on **SYS - House Assets**. Preserves history (month values, Loan Amount Left, Current Value, Type) and the **HOUSES - {House}** sheet; name stays reserved so it can't be reused. **`house_deactivate`** on **LOG - Activity** (Type: **House Expenses**, Action: **Tracking stopped**, Amount: **—**). UI is a secondary **Stop tracking** button in **Update** mode on web + sidebar with an inline confirm; on success, the Update dropdown, House Expenses selector, and Property Performance rows/cards drop the house immediately via the shared `getInactiveHousesSet_` rule (reused by `getHouseUiData`, `getHouseExpenseUiData`, and now `getHouseNamesFromHouseAssets_` in `property_performance.js`). New **Yes / No** writes inherit row text formatting via `writeActiveCellWithRowFormat_` (retrofitted into the add-house writers too). Help **House Values → Stop tracking**, **Activity log**, and **Property performance → Active houses only** sections added.
- **Planning → Debts — Consistency pass: Active + Add new + Stop tracking** — **`addDebtFromDashboard`** / **`deactivateDebtFromDashboard`** (**`debts.js`**) on the canonical **INPUT - Debts** sheet only (no `SYS - Debts` mirror). Self-healing `Active` column via `ensureDebtsActiveColumn_`; `TOTAL DEBT` summary row is never stamped/touched and is rejected as a reserved name on Add. Shared active rule: explicit `No / n / false / inactive` = inactive; blank / missing / unknown = active; legacy fallback (`balance > 0 || minPayment > 0`) used only when the Active column is absent. Duplicate-name validation spans active + inactive debts via `getAllDebtAccountNamesIncludingInactive_`. New rows inherit neighbor row formatting (borders/font/number formats/row height) via `findDebtTemplateRow_` + `PASTE_FORMAT`; Active cell written via `writeActiveCellWithRowFormat_`. Filtered readers now skip inactive debts: `getDebtsUiData` / `getDebtRows_`, `planner_core.js → normalizeDebts_` (so Rolling Debt Payoff waterfall, HELOC gate, focus/next-debt, payment windows, and liability summary), `dashboard_data.js` (`sumDebtBalances_`, `getHighUtilizationDebtIssues_`, `getDebtBillsDueRows_`, `getDebtPayeeMap_`), `quick_add_payment.js` (`adjustDebtsBalanceAfterQuickPayment_`, `resolveFlowSourceFromBillOrDebt_`). `activity_log.js → buildActivityKindLookup_` intentionally does NOT filter by Active so historical `quick_pay` / bill rows keep their **Debt** classification after a debt is stop-tracked. New activity events: **`debt_add`** (Type **Debt**, Action **Account added**, Amount = opening balance or 0) and **`debt_deactivate`** (Type **Debt**, Action **Tracking stopped**, Amount **—**; added to `activityLogIsNonMonetaryEvent_`). UI parity with Bank Accounts / Investments / House Values: `Dashboard_Body.html` Debts panel is a segmented **Update | Add new** switch with a secondary **Stop tracking** button in Update mode; inline name-error slot; action-specific status text ("Creating debt account…" / "Stopping tracking…"). Sidebar `DebtsUI.html` stays update-only (inactive debts auto-drop via filtered `getDebtsUiData`). Help **Planning → Debts** subsections and Activity bullets updated.

**Still open**  
- **Phase 5 (optional)** — Correlate events to **OUT - History** / planner run.  
- **Optional:** Activity **CSV export**; **last N events** on Overview; **onEdit** logging for manual Cash Flow typing.

**Pattern (reference)**  
- Audit after successful writes; log rows removable from UI for mistakes; deeper “reverse transaction” only when phased preconditions are met. **v1:** script-driven paths. **Later:** onEdit, etc.

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| Quick add | **Done** — `quick_pay` at end of **`quickAddPayment`**. |
| Bills Due → Skip | **Done** — **`skipDashboardBill`**. |
| Bills Due → Autopay | **Done** — dedupe key on refresh. |
| Bills → Pay (Flow Source) | **Done** — new Cash Flow rows populate **Flow Source** from **INPUT - Bills.Payment Source**, with server-side fallback (`resolveFlowSourceFromBillOrDebt_`) + case/whitespace-tolerant header lookup. |
| Manage bills → Add bill | **Done** — `bill_add` after **`addBillFromDashboard`** (`bills.js`); Category required. |
| Manage bills → Stop tracking | **Done** — `bill_deactivate` after **`deactivateBillFromDashboard`** (`bills.js`); sets **Active = No** on INPUT - Bills, shows **—** in Activity Amount. |
| Upcoming expenses | **Done** — Action-model cleanup: Upcoming is now an open-obligations board. Status is display-only (`Planned` / `Paid` / `Dismissed`; legacy `Skipped` sorts/filters the same as `Dismissed`); two actions per row — **Quick add payment** (single payment path, opens Quick Add with payee / due date / **remaining amount** / optional `CASH` / `CREDIT_CARD` flow-source hint pre-filled) and **Dismiss** (soft-deactivate preserving the row). Partial payments decrement the `Amount` column and keep the row on the board; full payments clamp remaining to 0, flip Status → `Paid`, and drop the row off the active board. `applyPaymentToUpcomingExpense` is called by `savePayment` after a successful Quick Add when `window.__pendingUpcomingPaymentId` is set. Activity: `upcoming_add` (monetary original planned amount), `upcoming_payment` (**non-monetary** audit trail — the money row is the paired `quick_pay`), `upcoming_status` (Dismiss), legacy `upcoming_cashflow` still rendered but no longer emitted. Action labels: **Upcoming added** / **Applied $X.XX (Remaining $Y.YY)** or **Applied $X.XX (Fully paid)** (falls back to **Payment applied** for legacy rows) / **Dismissed** / **Pushed to cash flow**. Retired: `updateUpcomingExpenseStatus`, `markUpcomingExpensePaid_`, `addUpcomingExpenseToCashFlow`, and the client's `setUpcomingStatus` / `addUpcomingToCashFlow` / `openUpcomingInQuickPayment`. |
| House expenses | **Done** — **`addHouseExpense`** → `house_expense`; CF via **Quick add** + **`suppressActivityLog`**. |
| Bank Accounts → Add new | **Done** — `bank_account_add` after **`addBankAccountFromDashboard`** (`bank_accounts.js`); INPUT + SYS rows (with `Active = Yes` stamped via `writeActiveCellWithRowFormat_`); Type is a controlled `<select>` from existing **SYS - Accounts** types; **Priority** numeric input (1–99, default 9) writes the canonical **SYS - Accounts → Priority** column; new **SYS - Accounts** rows inherit neighbor row formatting (borders/font/number formats/row height) via `findAccountsTemplateRow_` + `PASTE_FORMAT`; does not re-run full planner. **Amount in LOG - Activity** now shows the opening balance when provided (or $0.00 when blank) — no longer rendered as —. |
| Bank Accounts → Stop tracking | **Done** — `bank_account_deactivate` after **`deactivateBankAccountFromDashboard`** (`bank_accounts.js`); sets **Active = No** on every **INPUT - Bank Accounts** row across year blocks (self-heals the Active column per block at col 14) + mirror **SYS - Accounts**; preserves month history, Available Now, Min Buffer, Type, Use Policy, Priority, and reserves the name. Inactive accounts drop out of the Bank Account dropdown via `getInactiveBankAccountsSet_` (shared rule). Amount shows **—** in Activity. |
| House Values → Add new | **Done** — `house_add` after **`addHouseFromDashboard`** (`house_values.js`); INPUT + SYS rows + auto-created **HOUSES - {House}** sheet (canonical headers + column widths copied from an existing HOUSES tab); transactional rollback on partial failure. |
| House Values → Stop tracking | **Done** — `house_deactivate` after **`deactivateHouseFromDashboard`** (`house_values.js`); sets **Active = No** on every **INPUT - House Values** row (across year blocks) + mirror **SYS - House Assets**; preserves history + **HOUSES - {House}** sheet + name reservation. Inactive houses filtered out of House Values dropdown, House Expenses selector, and Property Performance via shared `getInactiveHousesSet_`. Amount shows **—** in Activity. |
| Investments → Add new | **Done** — `investment_add` after **`addInvestmentAccountFromDashboard`** (`investments.js`); INPUT - Investments row in the current-year block (with self-healed `Active` column) + mirror **SYS - Assets** row with neighbor-row formatting + optional month-seeded starting value; Type is a controlled `<select>` from existing **SYS - Assets** types. Transactional rollback on any write failure. Duplicate-name validation spans all year blocks (active + inactive) and SYS. Activity Type: **Investment**, Action: **Account added**. |
| Investments → Stop tracking | **Done** — `investment_deactivate` after **`deactivateInvestmentAccountFromDashboard`** (`investments.js`); sets **Active = No** on every **INPUT - Investments** row across year blocks + mirror **SYS - Assets**; preserves month history, Current Balance, Type, totals / delta, and reserves the name. Inactive accounts drop out of the Investment Account dropdown via `getInactiveInvestmentsSet_` (shared rule). Amount shows **—** in Activity. |
| Debts → Add new | **Done** — `debt_add` after **`addDebtFromDashboard`** (`debts.js`); appends a row to **INPUT - Debts** only (no `SYS - Debts` mirror) with `Active = Yes` stamped via `writeActiveCellWithRowFormat_`; neighbor-row formatting inherited via `findDebtTemplateRow_` + `PASTE_FORMAT`; `Acct PCT Avail` recomputed; `TOTAL DEBT` rejected as reserved; duplicate check spans active + inactive. Amount shows opening balance (or $0.00 when blank) in Activity. |
| Debts → Stop tracking | **Done** — `debt_deactivate` after **`deactivateDebtFromDashboard`** (`debts.js`); sets **Active = No** on the matching **INPUT - Debts** row only (never deletes, never renames, never touches `TOTAL DEBT`). Inactive debts drop out of the Debts dropdown (web + sidebar), `planner_core.js → normalizeDebts_` (Rolling Debt Payoff waterfall / HELOC gate / focus/next-debt / payment windows), Debt Overview, Bills Due debt matching, Quick add Flow Source inference, high-utilization issues, and debt-balance totals via the shared explicit-wins-with-fallback rule. Historical activity classification is intentionally preserved. Amount shows **—** in Activity. |

**Phased rollout**  
1. **Phase 1 — Quick add** (`quick_pay`) — **Done**  
2. **Phase 2 — Skip + autopay** — **Done**  
3. **Phase 3 — Upcoming** — **Done**  
4. **Phase 4 — House expenses** — **Done**  
5. **Phase 5 — OUT - History tie-in** — **Open** (optional)  
6. **Activity UI** — **Done** (filters, type from sheet, paging, sort); **CSV export** optional later

### Activity — Smart undo / “reverse transaction”

**Context:** Activity **Remove** always deletes the **LOG - Activity** row. **Phase 1 (donation)** is **implemented**: see **`tryDeleteDonationRowForActivityUndo_`** in **`donations.js`** and **`deleteActivityLogRow`** in **`activity_log.js`**. Phases 2–4 below are still optional follow-ons.

**Fool-proof principles (apply to any phase)**

1. **No guessing** — Never infer missing prior state (e.g. cell value before a skip wrote `0`); only use what was stored in log **Details** (consider `detailsVersion` if shape evolves).
2. **Precondition gate** — Before mutating INPUT/SYS: e.g. current cell **===** logged `newValue` (with same rounding rules as writes); donation row still matches a **fingerprint** of logged fields + `sheetRow`.
3. **UX** — Keep **Remove log only**; add a **separate** explicit action for “Reverse transaction and remove log” with a **second** confirmation listing exact sheet / row / cell / values.
4. **Idempotent / safe failure** — If the sheet changed since the log row was written, **abort** with a clear message (no partial silent fixes).
5. **Audit** — Prefer explicit success text listing what changed; optional future `activity_undo` log row if you want a paper trail.

**Phased implementation (in order)**

| Phase | Event type(s) | Risk | What it entails |
|-------|----------------|------|------------------|
| **1 — Done** | **`donation`** | **Lowest** | **Shipped:** Details carry **`sheetRow`** + fingerprint fields; **`deleteActivityLogRow`** calls **`tryDeleteDonationRowForActivityUndo_`** when safe, then deletes the log row. Older donation logs without **`sheetRow`** only remove the log line. |
| **2** | **`quick_pay`** | Medium | Details must include **`previousValue` / `newValue`** (and stable CF sheet + row + month resolution). Reverse **only if** current cell matches logged `newValue`. Debt balance change: undo only if Details allow **verification** of post-state, or **exclude** from v1 and document manual **INPUT - Debts**. |
| **3** | **`house_expense`** | Higher | Log must store house sheet, inserted row, and if CF was touched the same previous/new gates as Phase 2. Dual preconditions. |
| **4** | **`bill_skip` / `bill_autopay`** | High until logging fixed | **First** extend writers to log **previousValue**, **newValue**, and coordinates; **then** same cell-match reversal as Phase 2. **Do not** ship auto-undo for these without that logging. |

**Explicit non-goals**

- Generic undo from payee + amount + date alone.
- “Subtract logged amount from current cell” without proving current value still equals logged **newValue**.

**Activity Remove — dashboard scope (temporary)**  
- **Remove** in the web UI is **enabled only for `donation`** rows (`eventType` **donation**). Other types show a **greyed-out** control; **`deleteActivityLogRow`** rejects non-donation with a clear error (sheet-only delete still works). **Re-enable per type** as Phases 2–4 ship: set **`quick_pay`**, **`house_expense`**, then skip/autopay after logging upgrades—each needs UI enable + server gate + undo implementation.

### Next big item — Planning: Debt payoff projection (“path out of debt”)

**Status — Shipped (split into two Planning tabs).** The original scope landed as two products: **Debt Overview** (read-only reference view, renamed from the earlier working name "Payoff Path") and **Rolling Debt Payoff** (monthly decision engine with Standard / Details modes, narrative decision card, HELOC advisor, Payment result table with `[Add payment]` → Cash Flow → Quick add, and the "Why not more?" explainer). See **Help → Debt Overview** and **Help → Rolling Debt Payoff**, plus **SESSION_NOTES.md § Rolling Debt Payoff: Standard-mode UX sweep**. The design notes below are kept for historical context.

**Intent:** One **Planning** tab with **real projections** grounded in **sheet data**: **INPUT - Debts** (balances, APRs, minimums, active flags) plus **INPUT - Cash Flow** across **2025 / 2026** (and later years) to infer **typical payment pace** toward debt-linked payees. **Simulation** on top: **“If I pay $X more per month to account Y, how does the story change?”** (timeline, interest, ordering). **Read-only** for early phases — no writes to INPUT from this feature until explicitly scoped. Complements **Run Planner** (now-centric) with a **trajectory** view.

**Why Cash Flow over OUT - History for pace:** **OUT - History** is sparse (per planner run). **INPUT - Cash Flow** month columns hold **realized** payments — better for **median / typical** paydown and variability. **OUT - History** stays an **optional** default or sanity check, not the primary source.

**Caveats:** Revolving assumptions (no new charges, simplified interest/minimums), **payee → debt** mapping via alias rules, **scenario math** — document in Help.

#### Where it fits in the planner (UI)

**Planning → fourth tab** (“Payoff path” / “Debt projection”) — **`Dashboard_Body.html`** `#page_planning`, **`Dashboard_Script_PlanningDebtPayoff.html`**, **`PlannerDashboardWeb.html`** include. Optional: Overview link to this tab.

#### Data inputs (by role)

| Role | Source | Use |
|------|--------|-----|
| **Levels / rates** | **INPUT - Debts** + **`normalizeDebts_`** / alias map | Starting balances, APR, minimums, allocation |
| **Historical payment pace** | **INPUT - Cash Flow** (per-year sheets, e.g. 2025–2026) | Aggregate per month for lines mapped to debts; derive **typical monthly $** + date range for provenance |
| **Optional** | **OUT - History** | Fallback when CF coverage is thin |

#### Backend shape (stable core)

1. **`simulateDebtPayoffSchedule_(normalizedDebts, monthlyTotalToDebt, strategy, options)`** — month loop; minimums + extra (**avalanche** / **snowball** / **minimum-only**); accrue interest (document simplification); cap months (e.g. 600) and payload size.
2. **`getDebtPayoffProjection(payload)`** — load debts, run simulator, return JSON `{ summary, byMonth[], perDebtPayoffMonth, … }`; payload selects **manual** vs **inferred** monthly total when Phase 2 exists.
3. **Phase 2+** — **`inferDebtPaymentPaceFromCashFlow_(ss, years, aliasMap)`** (name TBD): roll Cash Flow rows into mapped buckets → **median** (or trimmed) monthly payment + metadata for UI (“Based on CF **…**”).

#### Phased delivery — **start Phase 1** to see shape end-to-end

| Phase | Scope | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **1 — Core sim + shell** | Fourth tab + **`getDebtPayoffProjection`** + **manual** monthly $ to debt + strategy + **Run projection** → table + summary (payoff month per account, approximate interest, debt-free month). **`debt_payoff_projection.js`** (split with **`planner_core.js`** as needed). Help stub. | **Visible vertical slice** without CF ingestion. |
| **2 — Real sheet defaults** | Infer pace from **2025/2026** (configurable) **INPUT - Cash Flow**; default monthly $ with **override**; **provenance** + low-coverage warning. | **Projections tied to actual payments.** |
| **3 — Outlined plan** | Milestone narrative from the same schedule object the table uses (single source of truth). | Readable “plan” beside numbers. |
| **4 — What-if** | +$X/mo to account **Y** vs baseline; **delta** (months, interest, outline). | Show how paying more changes the story. |
| **5 — Polish** | Chart, CSV, optional OUT - History line for defaults, edge rules (promo APR, HELOC) if needed. | Depth. |

**Order:** Engine + UI **first** (Phase **1**); then **real data** ( **2** ), **outline** ( **3** ), **simulation** ( **4** ).

**Frontend:** Reuse **`fmtCurrency`**, **`setStatus`**, Planning patterns; extend controls after Phase 1.

**Testing / docs:** **`TESTING_PLAN.md`** (avalanche/snowball, inactive, zero APR, **sparse CF**); **`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** when Phase 1 ships; **`SESSION_NOTES.md`** per phase.

**Explicit non-goals (early phases):** Auto-posting results to Cash Flow / **INPUT - Debts**; full issuer minimum engines.

**Related code:** **`code.js`** (`runDebtPlanner`, `buildUpcomingPayments_`); **`planner_core.js`** (`normalizeDebts_`); **`readCashFlowSheetAsObjects_`** / year tabs; **`Dashboard_Script_PlanningDebts.html`**; **`PlannerDashboardWeb.html`** includes.

### Rolling debt payoff (new Planning tab — separate from Debt Overview)

**Status — Shipped.** Now the **Rolling Debt Payoff** Planning tab (sibling to **Debt Overview**, which was the working name "Payoff Path" in this design note). Implementation lives in `components/RollingDebtPayoffDashboard.tsx` → `RollingDebtPayoffDashboardBundle.html`. Standard-mode UX (Cash-to-use-now, Decision card, HELOC card, Payment result table with **Small balance / Focus debt / Next debt / Excess** roles and **Paid off (this month) / Partially paid** actions, per-row **[Add payment]** → Cash Flow → Quick add, "Why not more?" breakdown → Cash Flow → Upcoming) and a single **Show details** toggle for the full planner output. The locked defaults below were preserved end-to-end; see **Help → Rolling Debt Payoff** and **SESSION_NOTES.md**. Historical design notes kept below.

**UI:** New sub-tab **next to** Debt Overview: **“Rolling debt payoff”** — own panel + script + server function; do **not** merge with Debt Overview.

**Locked defaults (implementation)**

1. **Mortgage / loan cash out vs debt mins**  
   - **Required expenses:** **INPUT - Cash Flow** Expense lines = source of truth for **actual cash out** (including mortgage/loan payments if present that month).  
   - **Minimum debt payments:** from **INPUT - Debts** only — **metadata / strategy context** in output; **do not add** to total required expenses (no double count).  
   - If CF has the mortgage/loan payment for that month, that amount is the required expense for that cash out.

2. **Stable vs variable rent**  
   - **Stable (recurring rent):** `Rent Mo House`, `Rent Oakley House - Section 8`, `Rent Oakley House - Tenant Part 1`, `Rent Oakley House - Tenant Part 2`, `Rent Oakley House - Tenant Part 3`, `Rent San Diego House`, `Rent MN House`.  
   - **Variable / non-recurring:** `Deposit San Diego House`, `Rent Oakley House - Section 8 Extra`, one-time catch-up rent, late fees, reimbursements, deposit-related amounts.  
   - **Tahoe:** do **not** treat as rent unless explicit Tahoe rental income is added later.

3. **San Jose low-rate “keep last”**  
   - Exact **INPUT - Debts** account name: **`Loan Depot - San Jose House`**.  
   - Add debts helper **`Priority Class`** (or equivalent): auto **`LOW_RATE_KEEP_LAST`** when account name is `Loan Depot - San Jose House` **or** APR **≤ 2.25%**.

4. **Minimum cash reserve**  
   - Default **`100000`**.  
   - Target: **assumptions/config sheet**; until it exists, **hardcode 100000** with a single constant / TODO to migrate to config.

5. **First month anchor**  
   - **Not** system date: anchor = **latest month column present** on **INPUT - Cash Flow** (e.g. `Apr-26` → that month is “this month”; next projected month is `May-26`).

6. **Credit card spend spike**  
   - **Primary:** per CC payee (match debt/card payees): current month vs **trailing 6-month median** for that payee — spike if **> 150%** of median **and** **≥ $500** above median.  
   - **Fallback** if **&lt; 3** months history: total CC spend vs **trailing 3-month average** of total CC — spike if **> 125%** of that average.  
   - **Portfolio:** total monthly CC spend **> 130%** of trailing 6-month median of **total** CC spend.  
   - Prefer distinguishing **new card spend** vs **payments**; if only net cash out, use expense as card cash out but **label confidence lower**.

8. **Credit card spend estimation (critical)**  
   - **Problem:** CF expense lines for cards may be **payments**, not true new spend.  
   - **If statement balance data exists:**  
     `New Spend = Current Statement Balance − Previous Statement Balance + Payments`  
   - **If only payments exist (no balance tracking):** treat CF card expense as **cash out**, **not** true spend; set **`credit_card_spend_confidence = LOW`**.  
   - **Optional:** track monthly card balances in a **separate table** for accurate spend.  
   - **Planning:** never assume **payment = overspending** automatically; **spike detection = warning**, not a hard constraint.

9. **RSU / stock income smoothing**  
   - **Do not** treat RSU as stable income; tag RSU / stock sales as **variable**.  
   - **RSU monthly baseline** = trailing **12-month average** of RSU sales (for projection context only).  
   - **Base plan:** ignore RSU baseline (**conservative**).  
   - **Projection (optional):** may include **50%** of RSU baseline.  
   - **Label:** `RSU income confidence = MEDIUM` (depends on company / vesting).

10. **Irregular expense smoothing**  
   - For any expense category: if **monthly value > 2× trailing 6-month median** → classify **irregular spike**.  
   - **Smoothed monthly expense** = **median of last 6 months** (use for **forward projections**).  
   - **Keep actual** value in historical / audit trail.  
   - **Examples:** Federal taxes, property taxes, large maintenance, one-time travel.

11. **Rental income normalization**  
   - **Per rental:** trailing **3-month average** rent.  
   - If **variance > 20%**, mark rental **unstable**.  
   - **Planning:** use **lower of** (trailing 3-month average, last known stable rent).  
   - **Confidence:** Section 8 rent = **HIGH**; market rent (San Diego, MO, etc.) = **MEDIUM**.

12. **Cash buffer accuracy**  
   - **Total cash** = all liquid accounts.  
   - **Available cash** = Total cash − **reserved buckets** (earmarked taxes, repairs, etc.).  
   - If reserved buckets **not** tracked: **`Available Cash = 85%` of total cash** (conservative haircut).  
   - **Planning:** use **Available cash** for decisions, not total cash.

13. **Debt paydown accuracy**  
   - If sheet balances **updated:** use directly.  
   - If **not:** estimate  
     `New Balance ≈ Prior Balance − Principal portion of payment`  
   - If principal unknown:  
     `Principal ≈ Payment − (Balance × APR / 12)`  
   - Mark **estimated balances** = **MEDIUM** confidence.

14. **Monthly plan stability guardrail**  
   - **Do not** shift long-term trajectory on **one** good/bad month.  
   - Require **2–3 consecutive** months of signal before adjusting projection / trajectory.  
   - **Example:** one bad month → ignore for projection shift; three bad months → adjust plan.

15. **San Diego property monitoring**  
   - **Monthly loss** = expenses − rent (per agreed definitions).  
   - If **trailing 6-month average loss > $1,500/month** → trigger **`REVIEW`**.  
   - If loss **persists 12 months** **and** **appreciation < 3%** → trigger **`CONSIDER_SALE`** (advisory only; **do not** force).

16. **Confidence scoring**  
   - Each **major number** in the plan should carry a **per-field confidence**: `HIGH` | `MEDIUM` | `LOW`.  
   - **Defaults by category:**  
     - **HIGH:** salary / payroll, mortgage payments (from CF as agreed), Section 8 rent.  
     - **MEDIUM:** market rent, RSU (and similar) **smoothed averages**, estimated loan balances when not sheet-updated.  
     - **LOW:** credit card “spend” when **no** statement balance data (payment-only / net cash out), highly irregular expenses.  
   - **Output:** include an **`overall_plan_confidence`** (aggregate score or label, e.g. weighted or worst-of-critical-path — **define in implementation** with a short rubric in Help) so the UI and JSON show how much to trust the month’s recommendations.

**Income buckets**

- **Variable income:** RSU sales, ESPP sales, bonus, tax refunds, other stock sales.  
- **Stable income:** **Cisco regular pay** + **recurring rents** (list above) only.

**Lump-sum split (variable inflows)**  
- **50%** debt · **30%** reserve/cash · **20%** flexible (configurable later).

**Extra debt payoff order (after CCs cleared by highest APR)**  
1. HELOC  
2. Tahoe mortgage  
3. San Diego mortgage  
4. MO mortgage  
5. San Jose mortgage **last** (`Loan Depot - San Jose House` / `LOW_RATE_KEEP_LAST`)

**Property stance**  
- **San Diego:** **HOLD / REVIEW** — flag persistent negative cash flow; **do not** force sale.  
- **Tahoe:** **protected lifestyle asset** — do **not** recommend sale.

**Output shape (reminder):** executive summary, **12-month** detail table, **84-month** roll with lighter long-range + annual debt totals, alerts/triggers, suggested actions, **per-field confidence** + **`overall_plan_confidence`**, **machine-readable JSON** (see prior chat schema).

### Consider — Bank / card / loan sync (Plaid or similar)

**Question:** How hard is it to hook **Plaid** (or **Finicity**, **MX**, **Yodlee**, etc.) into this app so **bank, credit card, and loan balances** land directly in the workbook / dashboard?

**Context (today’s stack):** **Google Sheets** is the system of record; **Apps Script** reads **`ACCOUNTS`**, **`DEBTS`**, **`BANK_ACCOUNTS`** / year blocks (`readSheetAsObjects_`, `bank_accounts.js`, `dashboard_data.js`, `runDebtPlanner` in **`code.js`**). Any aggregator should **still end by writing normalized rows** into those tabs (or a **staging** tab + merge) so the **rest of the planner stays unchanged**.

#### Short answer

**Not “drop-in easy” in Apps Script alone.** These APIs expect a **backend you control** that holds **`client_id` / `secret`**, creates **link tokens**, exchanges **public_token** for **access_token**, and optionally handles **webhooks**. That does not map cleanly to “only GAS + spreadsheet” because:

- **Secrets** must not live in the browser; **Script Properties** help in GAS, but you still need a **safe Plaid Link** flow and **token lifecycle** (refresh, revoke). **Webhooks** want an always-on HTTPS endpoint — awkward for GAS unless you add another service.
- **Plaid Link** runs in the **browser**; your dashboard is **HtmlService** — doable, but the real work is **Link → bridge → Sheets**, not a single REST call from the sheet.

**Practical shape:** **moderate effort with a small bridge service**; **high effort** if you insist on **100% Apps Script** with no other infra and production-grade behavior.

#### Architecture that fits this app

1. **Tiny backend** (common choices: **Node** on **Cloud Run**, **Cloud Functions**, **Firebase**) — stores Plaid secrets; implements e.g. **`/api/create-link-token`**, **`/api/exchange-token`**, optional **`/webhooks/plaid`**.
2. **Web dashboard** — loads **Plaid Link** (JS), receives **`public_token`**, sends it to the bridge; bridge stores **`access_token`** keyed to **user id** (not in the spreadsheet).
3. **Sync job** — schedule or **“Sync balances”** button: bridge calls **Plaid** (balances / liabilities), **maps** institutions → your **`Account Name`** / debt rows, **writes** via **Google Sheets API** *or* calls an **Apps Script web app** `doPost` with a shared secret (weaker pattern; document risk).

Apps Script can stay **consumer-only** (reads sheet after sync) or **orchestrator** that calls the bridge with **`UrlFetchApp`** + **Script Properties** (`BRIDGE_URL`, `BRIDGE_API_KEY`).

#### Effort rough cut

| Approach | Difficulty | Notes |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Manual / CSV / OFX** | Low | No aggregator; bank export → import. |
| **Plaid + small bridge + sheet writes** | **Medium** | Usual “right” first production shape; mapping + secrets + Link + one sync path. |
| **Plaid entirely in GAS** | Medium–high | Secrets + Link + refresh + errors in one place; webhooks harder; tighter security review. |
| **Full bidirectional + reconciliation UI** | High | Payee matching, duplicates, pending vs posted, multi-currency, liability fields vs custom **DEBTS** columns. |

#### Product / risk notes

- **Matching** — Plaid names **≠** your **`ACCOUNTS`** / **`DEBTS`** labels; need a **mapping table** (e.g. Plaid `account_id` → sheet row) and **merge rules** (overwrite balance only vs full row).
- **Liabilities** — Plaid **liabilities** help for cards; **loans** may still need **manual** planner fields (min payment rules, promo APR) unless you invest in normalization.
- **Compliance** — Provider **developer agreement**, **use case** review, **data retention**; not “just an API key.”
- **Multi-user** — Single household today is simpler; **per-user tokens** + auth is a large scope jump.

#### Alternatives to Plaid (same problem space)

- **Spreadsheet-first aggregators** (e.g. Tiller-style) that already write to Google Sheets.
- **Bank “export to Sheets”** or scheduled **CSV** import — low tech, no aggregator contract.
- **Finicity / MX / Yodlee** — same class: still want a **bridge** pattern and mapping.

#### Bottom line (planning)

Treat **aggregator → Sheets** as a **small sidecar + mapping layer**; keep the app **sheet-driven**. Reasonable to design and estimate; **not a trivial Apps Script–only weekend** if you want it **safe and maintainable**.

### Product / testing

**Car expenses (dedicated sheet today)**  
- **Open — design only for now:** Vehicle costs live on **their own sheet** in the workbook (not yet first-class in the web dashboard like **HOUSES - …** / house expenses). **Decide later:** integrate into the app (which nav tab, mirror house-expense pattern, tie to Cash Flow or not), keep as sheet-only with optional **LOG - Activity** later, or fold into another category. Capture requirements before building.

1. Subscriptions

3. Income/Expense Classification

4. Recurring Payments

6. Add ability to add new cards/loans etc to Debts Pages

7. ~~Add new bills to INPUT - Bills~~ — **Done.** Cash Flow → **Bills** → **Manage bills** → **Add bill** writes to **INPUT - Bills** via **`addBillFromDashboard`** (`bills.js`). Required: Payee, Category, Due Day, Default Amount, Payment Source. **Stop tracking** sets **Active = No** (never deletes). Activity events: **`bill_add`** / **`bill_deactivate`**. Header lookup is case/whitespace tolerant; missing optional columns (Payment Source, Category, Frequency, Start Month, Notes) are auto-added before write. See **SESSION_NOTES.md § Bills page: Manage bills, Flow Source, header tolerance**.

8. Cleanup the Debts/Bills sheets now that we have the other stuff
   - Only Debts should be here and other move to Bills

10. On the Debt update page we should update the screen on the bottom and right like we did for **Quick add**
   - The right updates but takes way too long - a BUG
   - The bottom is never shown we should add it - new

12. On Upcoming bills additions - Few changes
   - Bring a list of categories from a pull down menu
   - A2. If other - provide a field to add your own
   - B. Acount/Source
   - Make it a pull down from the list of Accounts or Credit Cards

13. We should split credit card into 2 parts
   - Normal ones I can use for everything
   - Merchant Specific like HD/Lowes/Macys etc…

14. tune loans/HELOC (principal vs interest, or partial paydown rules) to reduce from Debts

15. Need to hook up Tax workflow into the system

### Codebase cleanups (do over time)

Technical debt and consistency work suggested from repo review; no rush—pick off incrementally.

16. **Two dashboards** — `PlannerDashboardWeb` + modular `Dashboard_*` is canonical (`doGet`). `PlannerDashboard.html` is sidebar HTML from the spreadsheet menu. Decide: Web-only maintenance, or one shared source of scripts/styles so fixes aren’t duplicated.

19. **Status / `planner_status` audit** — After Bills Due → `bills_due_status`, move remaining global status to panel-specific elements where it makes UX sense. **Inventory (repo scan — update if code moves):**
   - **`Dashboard_Body.html`** — Markup: `#planner_status` container in the top bar (no `setStatus` here; anchor for all writers).
   - **`Dashboard_Script_Render.html`** — `runPlannerNow`: `setStatusLoading` / `setStatus('planner_status', …)` for planner run (success/error). *Expected:* stays near **Run Planner** in top bar.
   - **`Dashboard_Script_BillsDue.html`** — **Done:** `loadBillsDueUi_` **failure** → `bills_due_status` when `getBillsDueFromCashFlowForDashboard` fails.
   - **`Dashboard_Script_Payments.html`** — **Done:** `runDebtPlannerAfterQuickPayment_` failure → `pay_status` for `runDebtPlanner` errors.
   - **`PlannerDashboardWeb.html`** — `window.onerror` and `initDashboard` catch → write to `planner_status` (global init/JS errors). *Reasonable to keep global.*
   - **`PlannerDashboard.html`** (sidebar) — same pattern if still maintained (`TODO` item 16).

20. **Large `dashboard_data.js`** — Optional long-term split by feature (bills, snapshot, etc.) behind stable exported function names if that file keeps growing.

21. **Client globals** — `window.__dashboardBills` / `__dashboardRecurring`; optional single namespace object to avoid future collisions.

22. **Help vs inline UI** — Keep dense explanations in Help (pattern used for Bills Due); Bank Accounts add flow is covered in Help **Assets**; optional same pass for other tabs (Quick add edge cases, etc.).

24. **Dashboard charts (long term)** — Add trends without cluttering the UI. **Effort:** moderate; drawing is easy, the real work is **clean time series** from the backend (e.g. roll `OUT - History` or per-tab monthly series in `dashboard_data.js`). **Keep calm:** prefer **sparklines** in snapshot cards; at most **one** larger chart above the fold per page; extra charts behind **“Show trend”** or on **detail tabs** (e.g. full retirement chart on Planning, not Overview). **Good targets:** optional sparkline under **Net Worth** (or Cash) on Overview; health **score-over-time** inside **“Why this score?”**; **Buffer Runway** vs months; **Assets** panels (house/bank/investments) for **selected** entity only; **Debts** balance over time; **Cash Flow** income vs expenses if monthly history exists. **Skip / low value:** charting every row in Bills Due or dense forms.

## DONE (history)

Completed items kept for reference (original list numbers preserved).

**Activity ledger / UI (unnumbered)** — `house_expense` logging; no double ledger row when House Expense also writes Cash Flow; Activity **Type** filter + **getActivityDashboardData**; 20-row paging; inline date fields; Debt Planner email + Help **Debt Planner email**; Pay now/soon respect Cash Flow “handled” for current month; **Phase 3 Upcoming** activity events + no duplicate **`quick_pay`** when pushing from Upcoming.

**Bank Accounts (unnumbered)** — **Add new** path shipped (**`bank_accounts.js`**, dashboard + sidebar HTML/JS); **`bank_account_add`** activity; Help + panel title cleanup (see **Done (recent)** above for pointers).

**House Values (unnumbered)** — **Add new house** path shipped (**`house_values.js`**, dashboard + sidebar HTML/JS). Writes **INPUT - House Values** + **SYS - House Assets** (neighbor row formatting copied) and auto-creates **HOUSES - {House}** with canonical expense headers + column widths cloned from an existing HOUSES tab. Transactional rollback on partial failure. **`house_add`** activity event (Type **House Expenses**, sub-label **House added**). Duplicate-name validation is inline with a **`.field-error`** block under the House name input and focuses + selects the field. **Properties → House Expenses** selector refreshes on every navigation (`Dashboard_Script_Render.html`) so new houses are immediately usable. See **SESSION_NOTES.md § Assets → House Values: Add new house + integration polish** and Help **Assets → House Values** / **Activity log** / **HOUSES sheets** / **Sheet names**.

**5.** Fix SKIP issue in the Due Payments — adds 0 but does not refresh the screen (BUG). *(Marked done in prior testing; skip flow + UI refresh addressed.)*

**9.** Credit card should always list regardless of value in the Input Debts since we might have charged to them but not showing up or is that already there? *(Marked done.)*

**11.** New request on anything in debt other than the loans we should subtract that amount from the balance as long as it does not go < 0. If <0 then set that value to 0 after the payment is done. *(Marked done.)*

**17.** **Codebase — removed unused HTML** (done in repo): `Dashboard_Script_DueCards.html`, `Dashboard_Script_Core.html`, `Dashboard_Script_Utils.html` — were not referenced by any `includeHtml_` or `createHtmlOutputFromFile`. *Revert from git if a mirror is needed again.*

**18.** **HtmlService includes** — Documented in `WORKING_RULES.md` § HtmlService includes (`includeHtml_` + `getRawContent()`; no nested template tags in fragments). Cross-reference in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.

**23.** **Light safety net** — Manual checklist + `rg` include/orphan checks in `TESTING_PLAN.md` § Light safety net; notes on `PlannerDashboard.html` vs web app drift.

**2.** **Donations UI** — **Cash Flow → Donations** tab: append rows to **INPUT - Donation** by tax-year block (`donations.js`, `Dashboard_Script_Donations.html`, Help **Donations**). *(Sidebar-only UI not required for this item.)*
