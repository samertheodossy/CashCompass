TO DO and issues I see in the testing

*(Numbers below keep the original list IDs; gaps **5**, **9**, **11** in the product list and **17** in codebase items are recorded under **DONE** at the bottom.)*

## Open items (not done)

### Important — Activity / HISTORY flow (LOG - Activity vs OUT - History)

**LOG - Activity** = append-only **event** ledger (who/when/amount); **OUT - History** = **planner run** snapshots. Not the same grain. Implementation: **`activity_log.js`**, **`appendActivityLog_`**, Help **Activity log**.

**Done (recent)**  
- **Phase 4 — House expenses** — **`house_expense`** after **`addHouseExpense`**; if the form also posts to Cash Flow, **`quickAddPayment`** runs with **`suppressActivityLog: true`** so you do not get a second **`quick_pay`** row for the same save. Activity **Type** uses the House Expenses form type (Repair, **Maintenance**, Utilities, etc.; stored **Tax** displays as **Property Tax**).  
- **Activity page UI** — Logged **date range** (from/to on one row in the toolbar), **Payee** contains, **Type** dropdown (options computed from all rows in **LOG - Activity**, same rules as the Type column), **Amount** min/max, sortable table, **20 rows per page** with Previous/Next (**500** matching rows max per Apply; summary notes if truncated). Backend: **`getActivityDashboardData`**.  
- **Debt Planner email** — Short action block (overdue, pay‑now / pay‑soon line items), debts omitted when the current Cash Flow month is already “handled,” definitions in Help **Debt Planner email** (not repeated in the email body).

**Still open**  
- **Phase 3 — Upcoming** — Dedicated events for add / status / paid / push to Cash Flow (today, push to CF only adds **`quick_pay`**).  
- **Phase 5 (optional)** — Correlate events to **OUT - History** / planner run.  
- **Optional:** Activity **CSV export**; **last N events** on Overview; **onEdit** logging for manual Cash Flow typing.

**Pattern (reference)**  
- Append-only audit after successful writes only. **v1:** script-driven paths. **Later:** onEdit, etc.

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| Quick Add Payment | **Done** — `quick_pay` at end of **`quickAddPayment`**. |
| Bills Due → Skip | **Done** — **`skipDashboardBill`**. |
| Bills Due → Autopay | **Done** — dedupe key on refresh. |
| Upcoming expenses | **Open** — Phase 3. |
| House expenses | **Done** — **`addHouseExpense`** → `house_expense`; CF via Quick Pay + **`suppressActivityLog`**. |

**Phased rollout**  
1. **Phase 1 — Quick Pay** — **Done**  
2. **Phase 2 — Skip + autopay** — **Done**  
3. **Phase 3 — Upcoming** — **Open**  
4. **Phase 4 — House expenses** — **Done**  
5. **Phase 5 — OUT - History tie-in** — **Open** (optional)  
6. **Activity UI** — **Done** (filters, type from sheet, paging, sort); **CSV export** optional later

### Product / testing

1. Subscriptions

2. Donnations - add a new UI for it too

3. Income/Expense Classification

4. Recurring Payments

6. Add ability to add new cards/loans etc to Debts Pages

7. Add new bills to INPUT - Bills

8. Cleanup the Debts/Bills sheets now that we have the other stuff
   - Only Debts should be here and other move to Bills

10. On the Debt update page we should update the screen on the bottom and right like we did for Quick Pay
   - The right updates but takes way too long - a BUG
   - The bottom is never shown we should add it - new

12. On Upcoming bills additions - Few changes
   - Bring a list of categories from a pull down menu
   - A2. If other - provide a field to add your own
   - B. Acount/Source
   - Make it a pull down from the list of Accounts or Credit Cards

13. We should split credit card into 2 parts
   - Normal ones I can use for everything
   - Merchant Specific like HD/Lowes/Macys etc…

14. tune loans/HELOC (principal vs interest, or partial paydown rules) to reduce from Debts

15. Need to hook up Tax workflow into the system

### Codebase cleanups (do over time)

Technical debt and consistency work suggested from repo review; no rush—pick off incrementally.

16. **Two dashboards** — `PlannerDashboardWeb` + modular `Dashboard_*` is canonical (`doGet`). `PlannerDashboard.html` is sidebar HTML from the spreadsheet menu. Decide: Web-only maintenance, or one shared source of scripts/styles so fixes aren’t duplicated.

19. **Status / `planner_status` audit** — After Bills Due → `bills_due_status`, scan remaining `setStatus('planner_status', …)` for actions that belong next to a specific panel.

20. **Large `dashboard_data.js`** — Optional long-term split by feature (bills, snapshot, etc.) behind stable exported function names if that file keeps growing.

21. **Client globals** — `window.__dashboardBills` / `__dashboardRecurring`; optional single namespace object to avoid future collisions.

22. **Help vs inline UI** — Keep dense explanations in Help (pattern used for Bills Due); same pass later for Upcoming, Quick Payment edge cases.

24. **Dashboard charts (long term)** — Add trends without cluttering the UI. **Effort:** moderate; drawing is easy, the real work is **clean time series** from the backend (e.g. roll `OUT - History` or per-tab monthly series in `dashboard_data.js`). **Keep calm:** prefer **sparklines** in snapshot cards; at most **one** larger chart above the fold per page; extra charts behind **“Show trend”** or on **detail tabs** (e.g. full retirement chart on Planning, not Overview). **Good targets:** optional sparkline under **Net Worth** (or Cash) on Overview; health **score-over-time** inside **“Why this score?”**; **Buffer Runway** vs months; **Assets** panels (house/bank/investments) for **selected** entity only; **Debts** balance over time; **Cash Flow** income vs expenses if monthly history exists. **Skip / low value:** charting every row in Bills Due or dense forms.

## DONE (history)

Completed items kept for reference (original list numbers preserved).

**Activity ledger / UI (unnumbered)** — `house_expense` logging; no double ledger row when House Expense also writes Cash Flow; Activity **Type** filter + **getActivityDashboardData**; 20-row paging; inline date fields; Debt Planner email + Help **Debt Planner email**; Pay now/soon respect Cash Flow “handled” for current month.

**5.** Fix SKIP issue in the Due Payments — adds 0 but does not refresh the screen (BUG). *(Marked done in prior testing; skip flow + UI refresh addressed.)*

**9.** Credit card should always list regardless of value in the Input Debts since we might have charged to them but not showing up or is that already there? *(Marked done.)*

**11.** New request on anything in debt other than the loans we should subtract that amount from the balance as long as it does not go < 0. If <0 then set that value to 0 after the payment is done. *(Marked done.)*

**17.** **Codebase — removed unused HTML** (done in repo): `Dashboard_Script_DueCards.html`, `Dashboard_Script_Core.html`, `Dashboard_Script_Utils.html` — were not referenced by any `includeHtml_` or `createHtmlOutputFromFile`. *Revert from git if a mirror is needed again.*

**18.** **HtmlService includes** — Documented in `WORKING_RULES.md` § HtmlService includes (`includeHtml_` + `getRawContent()`; no nested template tags in fragments). Cross-reference in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.

**23.** **Light safety net** — Manual checklist + `rg` include/orphan checks in `TESTING_PLAN.md` § Light safety net; notes on `PlannerDashboard.html` vs web app drift.
